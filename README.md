 MyToken contract looks good as a basic token implementation. Here is a simplified explanation of your contract in key points:

License and Compiler Version:

The contract uses the MIT License (// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT).
Specifies Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or later.
Token Details:

tokenName is set to "gold".
tokenAbbrv is set to "coin".
totalSupply is initially set to 0, representing the total supply of tokens.
Balances Mapping:

balances is a mapping that tracks the token balance of each address.
Mint Function:

mint function increases the totalSupply and the balance of the _to address by the _value amount.
Burn Function:

burn function decreases the totalSupply and the balance of the _from address by the _value amount.
Ensures the _from address has enough balance to burn the specified amount, otherwise throws an error.
This contract allows for basic token creation and destruction, with the total supply and individual balances updated accordingly.
